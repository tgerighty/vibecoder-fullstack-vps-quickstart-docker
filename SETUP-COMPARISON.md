# Traditional vs Docker Setup Comparison

## Quick Comparison Table

| Feature | Traditional Setup | Docker Setup |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| **Isolation** | Services share host resources | Each service in isolated container |
| **Resource Management** | Manual with systemd | Built-in limits and monitoring |
| **Updates** | Update each component separately | Update container images |
| **Backup** | Backup files and database separately | Backup volumes and compose files |
| **Scaling** | Manual process management | Easy horizontal scaling |
| **Development** | Direct file editing | Build and deploy workflow |
| **Security** | Process-level isolation | Container-level isolation |
| **Complexity** | Simpler initial setup | Requires Docker knowledge |

## When to Use Traditional Setup

Choose the traditional setup if you:
- Are new to Docker and containers
- Need direct access to all services
- Have a simple, single-server deployment
- Want minimal abstraction layers
- Prefer using familiar Linux tools directly

## When to Use Docker Setup (Recommended)

Choose the Docker setup if you:
- Want better security through isolation
- Need consistent development/production environments
- Plan to scale or distribute services
- Want easier backup and migration
- Prefer declarative infrastructure
- Need resource limits and monitoring

## Key Differences

### Service Management

**Traditional:**
```bash
# PM2 for Node.js apps
pm2 restart all
pm2 logs

# PostgreSQL
sudo systemctl restart postgresql
sudo -u postgres psql
```

**Docker:**
```bash
# Docker Compose for all services
docker compose restart
docker compose logs -f

# PostgreSQL
docker exec -it app-postgres psql -U appuser appdb
```

### File Locations

**Traditional:**
- App files: `/var/www/app/`
- Nginx config: `/etc/nginx/sites-available/app`
- PostgreSQL data: `/var/lib/postgresql/`
- Logs: Various system locations

**Docker:**
- App files: `/var/www/app/`
- All configs: `/var/www/app/docker-compose.yml`
- PostgreSQL data: `/var/www/app/postgres-data/`
- Logs: `docker compose logs`

### Updates and Maintenance

**Traditional:**
```bash
# Update system packages
apt update && apt upgrade

# Update Node.js
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | bash -
apt-get install -y nodejs

# Update app dependencies
cd /var/www/app/api && npm update
cd /var/www/app/frontend && npm update
```

**Docker:**
```bash
# Update system packages
apt update && apt upgrade

# Update all services
cd /var/www/app
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

### Resource Usage

**Traditional:**
- Lower overhead (no container layer)
- Shared libraries between services
- Manual resource management

**Docker:**
- ~50-100MB overhead per container
- Isolated resources per service
- Built-in resource limits

### Security Model

**Traditional:**
- UFW firewall rules
- System user permissions
- Process isolation via systemd

**Docker:**
- UFW + Docker networking
- Container user namespaces
- Network isolation between containers
- No-new-privileges security flag

## Migration Path

### From Traditional to Docker

1. Backup your data:
   ```bash
   sudo -u postgres pg_dump appdb > backup.sql
   cp -r /var/www/app /var/www/app-backup
   ```

2. Install Docker setup:
   ```bash
   curl -sSL .../fullstack-harden-docker.sh | sudo bash
   ```

3. Restore data:
   ```bash
   docker exec -i app-postgres psql -U appuser appdb < backup.sql
   ```

### From Docker to Traditional

1. Export data:
   ```bash
   docker exec app-postgres pg_dump -U appuser appdb > backup.sql
   ```

2. Install traditional setup:
   ```bash
   curl -sSL .../fullstack-harden.sh | sudo bash
   ```

3. Import data:
   ```bash
   sudo -u postgres psql appdb < backup.sql
   ```

## Performance Considerations

- **Traditional**: ~5-10% better raw performance
- **Docker**: Better resource isolation prevents one service from affecting others
- Both setups can handle thousands of requests per second on modern hardware

## Conclusion

For most production deployments, the Docker setup is recommended due to:
- Better security through isolation
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Consistent environments
- Built-in health checks and recovery

The traditional setup remains a solid choice for:
- Learning and development
- Simple deployments
- Environments where Docker adds unnecessary complexity
